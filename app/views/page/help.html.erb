          <p>When making a transaction, your browser have to do proof of work. This is similar to what bitcoin miners have
            to do, but with IOTA this is done by the senders. If your computer is slow, this could take some time.</p>
          <p>Another thing to be aware of is that some browsers reduce the processing power of tabs when you leave them.
            You should therefore make sure to stay on the site until the work is done (sadly, we do not control this). </p>
          <p>Another approach for chrome users would be to do the transaction in a new window instead of a new tab. As
            long as the tab is selected in the new window, you are free to browse in the original chrome window without
            reducing processing power.</p>

          No sensitive information ever leaves your client. If you register an account your seed immediately gets
          encrypted before it is transferred to our server. That means we will never be able to restore your seed if you

          We don't store any sensitive information on our servers. If our site gets hacked the hackers will get access

          <p>When you replay a transaction, it is basically moved to a different part of the tangle, which may be more active.
            The reason for doing this is to increase the chances of it being picked up and validated by others</p>
          <p>iota-wallet.org replays/re-attaches your transactions automatically, so you don't normally have to think
            about it. If you on the other hand have a transaction that have been pending for a long time, you may want
            to replay it yourself.</p>
          <p> Also note the we don't allow you to replay double spends, because they can never be confirmed.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>IOTA addresses become insecure to use after it have been used to make a transaction. Because of this, this is what happens when you make a transaction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A list of your addresses with a positive balance is collected, and is used to fund the transaction</li>
          <li>The transaction is made by doing proof of work. You validate two other transactions at the same time</li>
          <li>All remaining funds on the addresses used in step 1 is transferred to a newly generated address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What this means is that if you send two transactions from the same address, one of them will be confirmed,
          and the addresses will have a balance of 0. The remaining transaction will therefore never be confirmed, because
          it don't have enough funds</p>
        <p>If this happens, the solution is simple: Do the pending transaction again. iota-wallet.org provides a warning
          before every attempt to double spend. If you get such a warning, simply wait until the last outgoing transaction
          has been confirmed</p>

          By opening the transaction, one of the following will be true:
          <ul>
            <li>You see a green re-attach button. </li>
            <li>You get a red warning telling you that the transaction is a double spend. In that case you will have to do the transaction again manually</li>
          </ul>
          iota-wallet.org replays your transactions automatically, but if it have been pending a long time and it is not
          a double spend, you can choose to replay it yourself.
