          WebGL2 is required to make transactions and to generate new addresses. If you get a message telling you to
          enable webgl2, try the steps in https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/enable.html. You also have to make sure that
          hardware acceleration is enabled in your browser. If none of the previous steps works, your device may not support WebGL2.

          <p>When making a transaction, your browser has to do proof of work. This is similar to what bitcoin miners have
            to do, but with IOTA this is done by the senders. If your computer is slow, this could take some time.</p>
          <p>Another thing to be aware of is that some browsers reduce the processing power of tabs when you leave them.
            You should therefore make sure to stay on the site until the work is done (sadly, we do not control this). </p>
          <p>Another approach for chrome users would be to do the transaction in a new window instead of a new tab. As
            long as the tab is selected in the new window, you are free to browse in the original chrome window without
            reducing processing power.</p>

          <p>There can be 2 reasons for this.</p>
          <p>Your IOTAs are stored on addresses, which again belong to your seed. When you enter the wallet, it will
            load up to 30 of your last addresses. If you have more than 30 addresses, and some of the first ones have a
            positive balance, the seed balance will be wrong. </p><p><b>Solution: </b>This can easily be fixed by pressing the "Load all"
            button in your wallet. Consider moving all your funds to one address when this happens.</p>
          <p>Another reason why the balance may not show up is if there has recently been a snapshot on the IOTA network.
          When a snapshot is taken, all unnecessary data is basically removed from the network. The result is that
            the wallet sometimes won't be able to find all your addresses. </p>
          </p><p><b>Solution: </b>Press the "Generate new address" button until your balance is correct.</p>

          No sensitive information ever leaves your client. If you register an account your seed immediately gets

          <p>When you replay a transaction, it is basically moved to a different part of the tangle, which may be more active.
            The reason for doing this is to increase the chances of it being picked up and validated by others</p>
          <p>iota-wallet.org replays/re-attaches your transactions automatically, so you don't normally have to think
            about it. If you on the other hand have a transaction that have been pending for a long time, you may want
            to replay it yourself.</p>
          <p> Also note the we don't allow you to replay double spends, because they can never be confirmed.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>IOTA addresses become insecure to use after it has been used to make a transaction. Because of this, this is what happens when you make a transaction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A list of your addresses with a positive balance is collected, and is used to fund the transaction</li>
          <li>The transaction is made by doing proof of work. You validate two other transactions at the same time</li>
          <li>All remaining funds on the addresses used in step 1 are transferred to a newly generated address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What this means is that if you send two transactions from the same address, one of them will be confirmed,
          and the addresses will have a balance of 0. The remaining transaction will therefore never be confirmed, because
          it doesn't have enough funds</p>
        <p>If this happens, the solution is simple: Do the pending transaction again. iota-wallet.org provides a warning
          before every attempt to double spend. If you get such a warning, simply wait until the last outgoing transaction
          has been confirmed</p>

          By opening the transaction, one of the following will be true:
          <ul>
            <li>You see a green re-attach button. </li>
            <li>You get a red warning telling you that the transaction is a double spend. In that case you will have to do the transaction again manually</li>
          </ul>
          iota-wallet.org replays your transactions automatically, but if it has been pending a long time and it is not
          a double spend, you can choose to replay it yourself.
